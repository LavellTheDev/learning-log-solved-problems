# Intro

Hello everyone,

My name is Lavell , but here you can call me Laziee. Before I got into the world of Tech I was an engineering student and before that a business major. I literally started coding so I could learn to build OSRS bots. 2 years later I am still in the process of figure all this crazy mess out.

This log was designed for two reasons.

1) Help me keep track of progress that I have made or am making.
2) To be a place that I push coding problems and challenges that I may or may have not solved.
3) Rack up on them green squares. :muscle:

# learning-log
 A personal catalog of skills gained, things to review, and links to useful resources. This is a constant work in progress.

 While this is mostly just a way for me to keep track of learning achievements, goals, and useful resources - I hope that anyone who stumbles across this list will find it somewhat helpful!  :)
